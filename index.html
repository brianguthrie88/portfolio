            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Brian Guthrie. I was born and I currently live
                in Columbia, SC. I graduated from the University of South
                Carolina with a Bachelors in Media Arts and I also minored
                in Computer Science. I currently am completing a web development
                bootcamp course because I would like a career change and the course 
                was the most logical thing for me time wise and money wise. I want
                to explore this topic and become better at it because I love to design.
                That is why I got into media arts, because computers and art are two things
                that I am good at using and creating. Sadly, my career in media arts did not
                turn out like I hoped so this web development journey, hopefully will
                be a better one. I am very motivated to learn this new skill and 
                very determined to get to the place I need to be in order to one day
                be a professional in this field. Please enjoy looking at all of the 
                websites I have created through my Portfolio. Thank you.
